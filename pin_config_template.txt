# Wire Pair Configuration
# Format: Pair X: GPIO[OUT_PIN] -> GPIO[IN_PIN]
# Example: Pair 1: GPIO17 -> GPIO27

Pair 1: GPIO__ -> GPIO__
Pair 2: GPIO__ -> GPIO__
Pair 3: GPIO__ -> GPIO__
Pair 4: GPIO__ -> GPIO__
Pair 5: GPIO__ -> GPIO__
Pair 6: GPIO__ -> GPIO__

# Instructions:
# 1. Fill in the Product Name and Product No
# 2. For each wire pair you want to test:
#    - Replace __ with the actual GPIO pin numbers
#    - OUT_PIN is the GPIO pin that sends the signal
#    - IN_PIN is the GPIO pin that receives the signal
# 3. Leave unused pairs blank or delete them
# 4. Save this file and use "Load from Template" in the Pin Configuration Form

# Example Configuration:
# Product Name: Test Wire Assembly
# Product No: TWA-001
# Pair 1: GPIO17 -> GPIO27
# Pair 2: GPIO22 -> GPIO10
# Pair 3: GPIO9 -> GPIO11
# Pair 4: GPIO5 -> GPIO6

# Notes:
# - Each GPIO pin can only be used once
# - Valid GPIO pins: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
# - Avoid using pins 2, 3, 4 (used for LEDs), 13, 15 (used for solenoids), 18 (used for buzzer)
